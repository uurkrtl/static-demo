Create a new project in IntelliJ and write a Java class with static and instance variables and methods.

-   Step 1: Create a class with a static variable 'totalCount' and an instance variable 'instanceCount'. Initialize both variables with the value 0.
-   Step 2: Write a static method 'incrementTotalCount' that increments the 'totalCount' by 1.
-   Step 3: Write an instance method 'incrementInstanceCount' that increments the 'instanceCount' for the object by 1.
-   Step 4: In the main method, create multiple objects of the class and call both the static and instance methods.
-   Step 5: Override the ToString method to output the current values of 'totalCount' and 'instanceCount'.


**Bonus Task:**

-   Create a new class 'Calculator' with a static method 'add' that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
-   Write code in the main method to call the 'add' method and print the result.
-   Optional: Implement additional static methods in the 'Calculator' class (subtraction, multiplication, division) and call them in the main method.
